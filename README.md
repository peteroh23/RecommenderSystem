# RecommenderSystem

This is a project that I have been working on that piggy-backs off of my REU research work at East Carolina University.

RS1 and RS2 are  movie recommender systems that make 5 distict recommendations based on a user's ratings of 20 different movies.

RS3 and RS4 uses interactive data from the user–– allows the user to rate 20 different movies on a scale fo 1 to 5–– to product more personalized recommendations.

In RS1-RS4, MovieLens dataset (100K and Latest) and graphLab library (recommender system algorithms) are used.

SurpriseRS uses the Surprise library to incoporate 4 different kinds of K-NN algorithms: K-NN Basic, K-NN Baseline, K-NN w/ Means, and K-NN w/ Z Score. This python script predicts ratings of a specific user and a specific item.
